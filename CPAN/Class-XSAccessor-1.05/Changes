1.04_03  Tue Nov  3 22:32 2009
  ** This release features some very radical changes. Test well. **
  - Replace use of perl hashes in the global hash key name storage with
    a full-blown, separate implementation of a hash table
    (Steffen, Chocolateboy)
  - Similarly, throw out the SV's for simple C strings.
  - Add a global lock for all modifications to global data structures:
  - The above three items fix RT #50454 (serious threading issues).
  - Add support for alternate use Class::XSAccessor { ... } syntax
