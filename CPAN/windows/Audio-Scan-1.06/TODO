General
-------
5.6 support?
Large buffers will still be allocated with artwork disabled:
  ASF, Ogg (hard to fix these)
Clean up various code by using buffer_get_bits
Handle stuff done by expensive SC Unicode regexes
Test under 64-bit Strawberry Perl 5.12.0
Add support for AC3 and DTS
Standardize error messages

MP3
---
Lyricsv2/3 support
Free-format support (not reading Xing/LAME tag properly)
Support VBRI mono file with wrong offset?
VBRI not scanned right in some files (MPEG-2 Layer 3)

ID3

Support iTunes iTunSMPB comment for gapless info, translate into encoder delay/padding
(would also need a way to send this info to player via slimproto)
  http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=48231&st=136
  2nd value: encoder delay (usually 528)
  3rd value: encoder padding
  4th value: length in samples of original track
Support iTunNORM, translate into replay gain values
  This would be useful
ID3v1 comment + COMM are not merged but stacked
ID3v1 genre + ID3v2 genre of same numeric code should be merged
